/*
    Binding and mutability
        1. A variable can be used only if it has been initialized.
        2. Use mut to mark a variable as mutable.
  
    Scope
        A scope is the range within the program for which the item is valid.

    Shadowing
        You can declare a new variable with the same name as a previous variable,
        here we can say the first one is shadowed by the second one.

    Unused variables

    Destructuring
        We can use a pattern with let to destructure a tuple to separate variables.
